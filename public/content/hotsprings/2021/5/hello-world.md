Hello World... this is my first post....
i hope everything dont break... when i deploy this thing :D

curently there is nothing here...
but ill try to keep add random thing to this site...
hope you enjoy :D

i've been trying to make Art Gallery up and running....
since it is the main reason why i built this site...
but for some reason i just spent all my time create pagination system without using backend..

its not that i hate backend or something...
i just simply cant... lol..

the thing is... im only can write backend with nodejs...
and... i cant find any cheap webhost that support nodejs...
best i can get is php... 

tbh... i dont really like working with php.. there is like a bunch of random symbol all over the place... im also not really into webdev... so i never try to learn php...

anyway... i finish the pagination thingy...
basically how its work is simple...

i list all my post then split it into chunk then save those list as json...
so i can just simply ajax request that json to get all pagination list...
its all in static public file...

i probably should back to fix Art Gallery...
i just need to add some simple logic and its should be up in no time...
ok...see you there...
